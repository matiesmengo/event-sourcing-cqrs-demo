# ADR 0006: Implement Observability Stack with Grafana, Prometheus, Loki, and Jaeger
## Context:

As the system evolves into a distributed microservices architecture that relies on CQRS, SAGA, and Kafka-based communication, the complexity of diagnosing and understanding system behavior has significantly increased.
Distributed workflows—particularly long-running SAGA transactions—require full visibility across multiple services and asynchronous event flows.
Without a robust observability layer, identifying bottlenecks, latency spikes, or failed compensating transactions becomes difficult and time-consuming.

## Decision:

We will integrate a complete observability stack composed of Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, and Jaeger to achieve full visibility across the platform.

- **Prometheus** will collect and store time-series metrics from all microservices (CPU, memory, request latency, Kafka consumer lag, etc.).
- **Grafana** will serve as the central visualization layer, providing real-time dashboards for metrics, traces, and logs.
- **Loki** will manage and query logs efficiently without the need for a full-text index, enabling correlation of logs with metrics and traces.
- **Jaeger** will be used for distributed tracing, enabling analysis of SAGA orchestration flows and identification of latency within or between services.

All services will expose standardized telemetry endpoints — using `/metrics` (via `io.micrometer`) for Prometheus-compatible metrics and OpenTelemetry instrumentation (via `io.opentelemetry`) for traces and logs — ensuring consistent and interoperable data collection across the entire system.
## Rationale:

Observability is essential for building resilient and self-healing distributed systems.
By implementing this stack:

- We gain **visibility into the entire transaction flow,** from the orchestrator through each service participating in a SAGA.
- We can **correlate metrics, logs, and traces** to identify the root cause of failures or performance degradation.
- We establish a foundation for **proactive monitoring, alerting, and performance tuning,** improving operational maturity and reliability.

## Consequences:
### Positive

- **Holistic visibility:** Unified access to metrics, traces, and logs across all services.
- **Root cause analysis:** Correlating traces (Jaeger) with logs (Loki) and metrics (Prometheus) enables fast, data-driven debugging.
- **Improved resilience:** Early detection of anomalies or performance regressions allows proactive recovery and tuning.
- **Operational maturity:** Enables continuous monitoring of SLIs, SLOs, and SLAs.

### Negative

- **Increased infrastructure complexity:** Requires additional services to be deployed, configured, and maintained.
- **Resource overhead:** Continuous collection and storage of metrics, logs, and traces increase CPU, memory, and storage consumption.
- **Alert fatigue risk:** Poorly configured alerts can overwhelm the team; alert rules must be carefully tuned.
